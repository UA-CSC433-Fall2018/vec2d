This includes the sample code we built in class on Sept. 12 for testing
out constructing complex types as C++ objects.  We covered class
constructors, passing by reference, copy constructors vs. assignment
operators, arithmetic operators, and stream insertion.

Files:

* vec2d.* includes the class declaration and definition.
* main.cpp includes some code that test's out the features of vec2d.
